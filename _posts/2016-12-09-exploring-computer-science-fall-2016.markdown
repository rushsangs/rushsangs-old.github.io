At Rutgers University, I took up the role of Peer Instructor for the FIGS (First-Year Interest Group Seminar) program in Fall of 2016. For this role, I worked on creating a course syllabus and lecture plan, submitting it to the department for approval, working with them on improving it, and finally teaching freshmen students a ten-week one-credit seminar-based class called "Exploring Computer Science."
