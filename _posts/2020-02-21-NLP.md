As part of my teaching mentorship at University of Utah, I served as Teaching Assistant for a crosslisted Introduction to Natural Language Processing course with mentorship from **Prof. Ellen Riloff**. For this course, in addition to grading duties, I designed some assignments, exams, and delivered lectures as guest instructor for a week. Some of the materials that I designed for the course are provided in this post.
